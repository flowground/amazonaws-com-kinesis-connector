The shard iterator\nspecifies the position in the shard from which you want to start reading data\nrecords sequentially. If there are no records available in the portion of the\nshard that the iterator points to, GetRecords returns an empty list. It might\ntake multiple calls to get to a portion of the shard that contains records.\n\nYou can scale by provisioning multiple shards per stream while considering\nservice limits (for more information, see Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Limits\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/service-sizes-and-limits.html] in\nthe Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide). Your application should have\none thread per shard, each reading continuously from its stream. To read from a\nstream continually, call GetRecords in a loop. Use GetShardIterator to get the\nshard iterator to specify in the first GetRecords call. GetRecords returns a new\nshard iterator in NextShardIterator. Specify the shard iterator returned in \nNextShardIterator in subsequent calls to GetRecords. If the shard has been\nclosed, the shard iterator can't return more data and GetRecords returns null in \nNextShardIterator. You can terminate the loop when the shard is closed, or when\nthe shard iterator reaches the record with the sequence number or other\nattribute that marks it as the last record to process.\n\nEach data record can be up to 1 MiB in size, and each shard can read up to 2 MiB\nper second. You can ensure that your calls don't exceed the maximum supported\nsize or throughput by using the Limit parameter to specify the maximum number of\nrecords that GetRecords can return. Consider your average record size when\ndetermining this limit. The maximum number of records that can be returned per\ncall is 10,000.\n\nThe size of the data returned by GetRecords varies depending on the utilization\nof the shard. The maximum size of data that GetRecords can return is 10 MiB. If\na call returns this amount of data, subsequent calls made within the next 5\nseconds throw ProvisionedThroughputExceededException. If there is insufficient\nprovisioned throughput on the stream, subsequent calls made within the next 1\nsecond throw ProvisionedThroughputExceededException. GetRecords doesn't return\nany data when it throws an exception. For this reason, we recommend that you\nwait 1 second between calls to GetRecords. However, it's possible that the\napplication will get exceptions for longer than 1 second.\n\nTo detect whether the application is falling behind in processing, you can use\nthe MillisBehindLatest response attribute. You can also monitor the stream using\nCloudWatch metrics and other mechanisms (see Monitoring\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/monitoring.html] in the Amazon\nKinesis Data Streams Developer Guide).\n\nEach Amazon Kinesis record includes a value, ApproximateArrivalTimestamp, that\nis set when a stream successfully receives and stores a record. This is commonly\nreferred to as a server-side time stamp, whereas a client-side time stamp is set\nwhen a data producer creates or sends the record to a stream (a data producer is\nany data source putting data records into a stream, for example with PutRecords\n). The time stamp has millisecond precision. There are no guarantees about the\ntime stamp accuracy, or that the time stamp is always increasing. For example,\nrecords in a shard or across a stream might have time stamps that are out of\norder.\n\nThis operation has a limit of five transactions per second per account.",

Upon receiving the\nrequest, Kinesis Data Streams returns immediately and sets the status of the\nstream to UPDATING. After the update is complete, Kinesis Data Streams sets the\nstatus of the stream back to ACTIVE. Depending on the size of the stream, the\nscaling action could take a few minutes to complete. You can continue to read\nand write data to your stream while its status is UPDATING.\n\nTo update the shard count, Kinesis Data Streams performs splits or merges on\nindividual shards. This can cause short-lived shards to be created, in addition\nto the final shards. We recommend that you double or halve the shard count, as\nthis results in the fewest number of splits or merges.\n\nThis operation has the following default limits. By default, you cannot do the\nfollowing:\n\n *  Scale more than twice per rolling 24-hour period per stream\n   \n   \n *  Scale up to more than double your current shard count for a stream\n   \n   \n *  Scale down below half your current shard count for a stream\n   \n   \n *  Scale up to more than 500 shards in a stream\n   \n   \n *  Scale a stream with more than 500 shards down unless the result is less than\n   500 shards\n   \n   \n *  Scale up to more than the shard limit for your account\n   \n   \n\nFor the default limits for an AWS account, see Streams Limits\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/service-sizes-and-limits.html] in\nthe Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide.
